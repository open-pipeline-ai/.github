# Open Pipeline AI

**Open Pipeline AI** is an open-source initiative building modular, composable infrastructure for modern AI pipelines.

Our work is motivated by the challenges faced by large-scale scientific consortia and mission-driven organizations, where resources are often limited and workflows are complex. We aim to develop AI tools that enhance information access and streamline engineering and research processes.

While our tooling is domain-agnostic, it is shaped by these realities, ensuring it can support collaborative, reproducible, and maintainable AI workflows.

We focus on building reusable components with clean interfaces and swapple strategies to cover the entire lifecycle of scientific projects: from documentation to implementation, analysis, and code reuse.

## Scope and Non-Goals
Open Pipeline AI focuses on general-purpose, reusable infrastructure.
We intentionally do not include:
- Project- or organization-specific data
- Domain-restricted configurations
- Internal or proprietary integrations

This keeps the tooling broadly applicable and suitable for open-source collaboration.

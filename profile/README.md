# Open Pipeline AI

**Open Pipeline AI** is an open-source organization focused on building modular, composable building blocks for modern AI systems.

We develop reusable infrastructure for document processing, chunking, retrieval, evaluation, and agent-based workflows — with an emphasis on **clean interfaces, pluggable strategies, and production-oriented design.**

Our goal is to make it easier for teams to build, swap, and evolve AI pipelines without coupling to specific vendors, models, or internal data sources.

## Scope and Non-Goals
Open Pipeline AI focuses on general-purpose, reusable infrastructure.
We intentionally do not include:
- Project- or organization-specific data
- Domain-restricted configurations
- Internal or proprietary integrations

This keeps the tooling broadly applicable and suitable for open-source collaboration.

# Open Pipeline AI

**Open Pipeline AI** is an open-source organization focused on building modular, composable building blocks for modern AI systems.

We develop reusable infrastructure for document processing, chunking, retrieval, evaluation, and agent-based workflows — with an emphasis on **clean interfaces, pluggable strategies, and production-oriented design.**

Our goal is to make it easier for teams to build, swap, and evolve AI pipelines without coupling to specific vendors, models, or internal data sources.

Open, modular building blocks for AI pipelines, retrieval systems, and agent workflows.
